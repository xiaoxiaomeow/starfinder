This plasma weapon not only delivers a powerful blast capable of penetrating a colossus’s thick hide, but it delivers a blast of light and noise drawing the target’s attention from others. Some desperation cannons are used in only one battle, unless they’re later recovered from wreckage by scavengers.","source":"Near Space pg. 149","level":"15","price":"119,500","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"","damage":"6d12","damageType":["E","F"],"critical":"Nuisance","bulk":"2","special":["Bright","penetrating","unwieldy"],"capacity":"100 charges"}
