Carbon steel blades bite deeply, causing bleeding wounds. The blade of an ultrathin curve blade looks delicate, but it is as hard as carbon steel and keeps a fine edge. Buzzblade curve blades vibrate when powered, tearing organic flesh and causing additional bleed damage. Dimensional slice curve blades have only a narrow visible blade area, surrounded by a solid aura; these are the sharpest and most dangerous curve blades on the market.","source":"Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 173","level":"20","price":"815,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"12d10","damageType":["S"],"critical":"bleed 6d6","bulk":"2","special":["powered (capacity 40 usage 2)"],"capacity":""}
