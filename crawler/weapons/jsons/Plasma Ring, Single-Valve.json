{"key":"Plasma Ring, Single-Valve","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Single-Valve&Family=Plasma Ring","family":"Plasma Ring","name_en":"Plasma Ring, Single-Valve","description_en":"Plasma rings are relatively flat, circular weapons with an easily grippable interior, allowing them to be used in a variety of orientations. Plasma cycles through a channel within the ring at high speeds, and a release valve allows a stream of plasma to escape in a directed jet. Single-valve plasma rings produce a small discharge, while dual-valve plasma rings have a synchronized pair of valves to produce a larger discharge. Multichannel plasma rings build plasma in a series of parallel rings that vent into a single release valve for an extremely powerful blast.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 43","level":"17","price":"280,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Plasma","damage":"4d8","damageType":["E","F"],"critical":"wound","bulk":"L","special":["â€”"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
