A tactical maul is as much an instrument for hammering posts into the ground as a weapon. Advanced mauls include dense, heavy cores to deliver a more forceful blow. Elite mauls and paragon mauls are designed and manufactured more for war than labor, although the weapons can be used as tools.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 53","level":"20","price":"724,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Basic Melee","category":"","damage":"15d8","damageType":["B"],"critical":"knockdown","bulk":"1","special":["analog","unwieldy"],"capacity":""}
