{"key":"Divergent Laser, Wide-Spectrum","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Wide-Spectrum&Family=Divergent Laser","family":"Divergent Laser","name_en":"Divergent Laser, Wide-Spectrum","description_en":"Originally developed alongside convergent lasers, divergent lasers use multiple laser beams emitting from a blocky casing to produce a cone-shaped output. This weapon’s damage is significantly less than that achieved by the convergent lasers, but the same systems that synchronize wavelengths in a convergent laser allow the divergent laser to focus on multiple targets. The single-color beam of a single-wave divergent laser sets it apart from the shimmering colors of a multiwave divergent laser. A wide-spectrum divergent laser has a nearly white beam and could be mistaken for a spotlight at a glance—though not by a target struck by one!","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 40","level":"12","price":"41,200","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Laser","damage":"4d8","damageType":["F"],"critical":"burn 2d6","bulk":"2","special":["blast","unwieldy"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
