The frostbite-class zero knife is an easily obtained weapon whose blade rapidly accumulates flakes of frozen material in most atmospheres. The more advanced hailstorm-class, blizzard-class, avalancheclass, and icequake-class zero knives incorporate technology that eliminates the build-up.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 36","level":"20","price":"729,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Cryo","damage":"7d6","damageType":["C"],"critical":"staggered","bulk":"L","special":["conceal","operative","powered (capacity 40 usage 1)"],"capacity":""}
