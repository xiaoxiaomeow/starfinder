The design of tetrad rings is proprietary witchwyrd technology, which makes them expensive and difficult to find. They are manufactured in only three models: tactical, advanced, and elite. All three are elaborate sets of rings covered in delicate carvings, with a wire mesh to house the battery. Advanced and elite models have finer decorations.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 54","level":"12","price":"39,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"","damage":"2d6","damageType":["B"],"critical":"push (5 ft.)","bulk":"L","special":["force"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
