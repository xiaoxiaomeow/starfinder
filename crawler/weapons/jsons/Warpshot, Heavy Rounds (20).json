{"key":"Warpshot, Heavy Rounds (20)","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Heavy Rounds&Family=Warpshot","family":"Warpshot","name_en":"Warpshot, Heavy Rounds (20)","description_en":"Made from razor-sharp fragments of warpstitcher claws housed within reinforced bullets, scattergun shells, or warheads, warpshot transforms on impact into whatever would best devastate the target. If warpshot ammunition hits a creature vulnerable to a particular damage type, the warpshot ammunition’s damage changes to that type. If warpshot ammunition’s damage would be reduced by the target’s resistances, the ammunition’s damage changes to force damage. This fusion never causes a weapon that normally targets KAC to target EAC. Due to the scarcity of warpstitchers and the dangers in harvesting the necessary material, warpshot ammunition is incredibly rare.","source":"","level":"","price":"","hands":"","proficiency":"","category":"","damage":"","damageType":[],"critical":"","bulk":"","special":[]}
