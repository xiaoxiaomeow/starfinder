This crystal focuses infrared light on a distant foe, causing the target to burst into flames. Assassins and drow in particular often favor the weapon due to its absence of any visible discharge. Ember, blaze, inferno, and solar flare igniters are common in many places.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 38","level":"15","price":"108,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"Flame","damage":"â€”","damageType":[],"critical":"burn 4d6","bulk":"1","special":["ignite 4d6"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
