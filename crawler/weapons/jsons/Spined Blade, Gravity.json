Replicas of these ancient weapons can be found in the Museum of Ancestral Technology on the Idari. Modern warriors use refined versions of the weapon that are effective at delivering poisons and similar substances through contemporary armor. You apply such substances to the blade per rules found on page 232 of the Core Rulebook.
