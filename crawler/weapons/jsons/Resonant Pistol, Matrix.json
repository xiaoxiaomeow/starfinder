{"key":"Resonant Pistol, Matrix","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Matrix&Family=Resonant Pistol","family":"Resonant Pistol","name_en":"Resonant Pistol, Matrix","description_en":"The crystalline structure inside a resonant pistol comes from the same synthetic material used in the resonant gauntlet. An electrical current can be directed through a long, conical barrel fitted with layers of the crystal, causing the material to reverberate with a devastating ultrasonic frequency. These weapons are noted for their ease of use, since they create no recoil. The only indication that these weapons have fired is a faint, high-pitched beep. Resonant pistols using a crystal lattice are more common and less expensive than those that contain a crystal matrix.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 50","level":"7","price":"6,100","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Sonic","damage":"1d6","damageType":["So"],"critical":"deafen","bulk":"L","special":["boost 1d6"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
