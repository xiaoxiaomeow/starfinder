Dwarves in the Diasporan Star Citadels first developed storm hammers to bring larger foes to a more manageable height; many bear aesthetic designs hearkening to Angradd and other dwarven motifs. The materials used in a storm hammer’s construction determine the magnetic force and thereby the strength of the weapon; available versions include diamagnetic, paramagnetic, ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and metamagnetic storm hammers.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 48","level":"20","price":"728,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Shock","damage":"20d6","damageType":["B","E"],"critical":"knockdown","bulk":"1","special":["powered (capacity 20 usage 2)"],"capacity":""}
