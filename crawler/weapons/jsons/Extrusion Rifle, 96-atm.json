The bulk of the rifle is a slender and reinforced cylindrical barrel. When fired, a piston travels from one end of the barrel to the other, compressing the gases inside to extreme pressures before the other end opens and release the projectile. A series of baffles at the rifle’s tip stabilize the pressure wave so that it maintains cohesion over long distances and retains enough power to punch a perfectly clean hole into its target, though it can be modulated to simply hit a target’s surface with forceful impact.","source":"Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 79","level":"13","price":"55,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Sniper","category":"Projectile","damage":"4d10","damageType":["B"],"critical":"Knockdown","bulk":"2","special":["Sniper (750 ft.)","stun","unwieldy"],"capacity":"40 charges "}
