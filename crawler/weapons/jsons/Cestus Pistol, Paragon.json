{"key":"Cestus Pistol, Paragon","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Paragon&Family=Cestus Pistol","family":"Cestus Pistol","name_en":"Cestus Pistol, Paragon","description_en":"This weapon consists of a black leather glove that is mounted with a small, single-round firearm. Unlike most firearms, the weapon is designed to fire when pressure is placed upon its barrel rather than using a hand-based triggering mechanism. As a result, wielders must press a cestus pistol up against whatever they intend to shoot in order to discharge the weapon’s round, giving the weapon limited range.","source":"Character Operations Manual pg. 123","level":"11","price":"24,400","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"","damage":"2d10","damageType":["P"],"critical":"Bleed 1d6","bulk":"—","special":["Conceal","punch gun"],"capacity":"1 round"}
