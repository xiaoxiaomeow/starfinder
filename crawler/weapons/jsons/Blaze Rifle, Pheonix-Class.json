Compared to other petrol weapons, the blaze rifle fires a far narrower stream of petrol, which allows for greater accuracy. Fire-loving mercenaries often choose the blaze rifle to avoid charring their allies. Ifrit-, salamander-, hellhound-, firedrake-, and phoenixclass blaze rifles are common throughout the Pact Worlds.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 37","level":"16","price":"153,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"Flame","damage":"5d10","damageType":["F"],"critical":"burn 4d6","bulk":"1","special":["analog","unwieldy"],"capacity":"40 petrol"}
