While traditionally crafted with shark’s teeth, a toothblade can be crafted with the teeth of any carnivorous predator. The blade slices through water efficiently, and particularly vicious blows result in some of the teeth dislodging from the weapon to embed in the target’s flesh.","source":"Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 55","level":"9","price":"12,700","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"4d4","damageType":["P"],"critical":"Embed 3d4","bulk":"1","special":["Analog","underwater"],"capacity":""}
