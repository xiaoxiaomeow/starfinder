They create a powerful degeneration wave that affects creatures and objects at the subatomic level. Creatures caught in the explosion of a degeneration grenade must attempt a Fortitude saving throw as their cells begin to collapse; on a failure, the creature takes 5d6 fire damage at the beginning of each of their turns and is fatigued. At the end of each of their turns, the creature can attempt a new Fortitude save to end this effect with a cumulative +1 bonus.","source":"Starfinder #33: Dominion’s End pg. 49","level":"17","price":"40,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Grenade","category":"","damage":"—","damageType":[],"critical":"—","bulk":"L","special":["Explode (11d6 A & So","degeneration 5d6","20 ft.)","hybrid"],"capacity":"Drawn"}
