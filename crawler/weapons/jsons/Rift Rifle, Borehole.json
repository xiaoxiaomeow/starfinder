Instead, dozens of sigil-covered ceramic coils fill its squat barrel. Once charged, the coils destabilize planar boundaries in a targeted area to create a small, localized teleportation field. The field affects the individual cells and chemical bonds that comprise a target’s physical form, and the weapon deals damage by violently and simultaneously teleporting these minuscule components a short but devastating distance.","source":"Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 79","level":"19","price":"600,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Sniper","category":"","damage":"11d10","damageType":["S"],"critical":"Corrode 4d6","bulk":"2","special":["Force","sniper (800 ft.)","unwieldy"],"capacity":"80 charges "}
