Harmonic models use focused sound arrays that are similar in their output, while interference versions combine sounds to increased effects. Infrasonic and ultrasonic models are like the interference version, but they also use sound waves outside the normal hearing spectrum.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 51","level":"14","price":"77,400","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Sonic","damage":"4d4","damageType":["So"],"critical":"â€”","bulk":"L","special":["operative","powered (capacity 20 usage 4)"],"capacity":""}
