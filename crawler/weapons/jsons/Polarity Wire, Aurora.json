When triggered, the gauntlet launches the needle toward a target, channeling a deadly shock along the wire a split second later. After this, the gauntlet rapidly recoils the tethered needle in preparation for additional attacks. Due to the weapon’s design, a polarity wire can’t attack targets beyond its first range increment.","source":"Tech Revolution pg. 61","level":"17","price":"232,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Shock","damage":"8d4","damageType":["E","P"],"critical":"Electrocute AR","bulk":"L","special":["Injection","integrated (1 slot)"],"capacity":"20 charges "}
