While ancient manicas may have taken time to don, modern-day versions cover the arm quickly with the assistance of spring-loaded mechanisms. Gladiator manicas are favored by players of martial sports such as brutaris, despite their ungainly size preventing other weapons being wielded with the same hand.","source":"Starfinder #46: The Perfect Storm pg. 45","level":"16","price":"172,600","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"9d8","damageType":["B"],"critical":"push (15 ft.)","bulk":"1","special":["analog","block","unwieldy"],"capacity":""}
