Long rods running in parallel lines form a barrel-like structure that makes such a pistol easy to identify. The available models of graviton pistols start at linear, with vector, tensor, and chiral models are able to move a target increasing distances.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 52","level":"13","price":"49,500","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"","damage":"â€”","damageType":[],"critical":"knockdown","bulk":"2","special":["gravitation (25 ft.)"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
