Because the sap (rather than the weapon itself) entangles creatures, targets are not anchored to the xenolash. Grown in extraordinary conditions by Xenowardens and primarily sold only to those they trust, the plants derive their sustenance and amber-like sap from light, ambient energy, and atmospheric chemicals.","source":"Pact Worlds pg. 194","level":"18","price":"409,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"9d8","damageType":["A","S"],"critical":"corrode 6d4","bulk":"1","special":["analog","disarm","reach","trip"],"capacity":""}
