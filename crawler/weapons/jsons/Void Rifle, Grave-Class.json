{"key":"Void Rifle, Grave-Class","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Grave-Class&Family=Void Rifle","family":"Void Rifle","name_en":"Void Rifle, Grave-Class","description_en":"A firearm designed with crystals from the Plane of Shadow, a void rifle is unique in that power flowing through those crystals allows the rifle to fire inky bolts of life-sapping cold. The rifleâ€™s frigid energy can harm only the living, so it does nothing to constructs and undead. Regardless, the rifle remains a favorite of followers of Urgathoa. Grave- and crypt-class void rifles are an option for standard issue among rank-and-file marines of the Eoxian navy, while tomb-, ossuary-, and barrow-class void rifles are reserved for elite forces.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 36","level":"19","price":"606,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"Cryo","damage":"6d10","damageType":["C"],"critical":"suffocate","bulk":"1","special":["antibiological"],"capacity":"80 charges"}
