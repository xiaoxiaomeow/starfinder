A rail cannon generates such phenomenal force that its rounds can pass entirely through multiple targets, allowing the user to hit multiple targets in a line. Tactical rail cannons are precise and effective, while advanced rail cannons offer more firepower; elite and paragon rail cannons are generally used only by heavyweapons specialists in professional military groups.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 44","level":"19","price":"591,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Projectile","damage":"12d10","damageType":["P"],"critical":"bleed 4d6","bulk":"2","special":["line","unwieldy"],"capacity":"60 rounds"}
