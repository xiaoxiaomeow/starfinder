They were invented by a flotilla of merged barathus that directed its efforts toward creating such a weapon, and its success has resulted in the continued production of the surgecaster as a viable commercial endeavor. Only two models are currently available on the market: a standard surgecaster and an advanced surgecaster, though the merged barathu entity appears to be continuing its research and development efforts.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 48","level":"14","price":"83,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"Shock","damage":"3d10","damageType":["E"],"critical":"arc 2d10","bulk":"1","special":["boost 1d10","living"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
