These instantaneous black holes tear apart nearby matter and, in the process, hurl away any victims who can’t clear the area. The singularity typically lasts for a split-second, yet slivers of the microscopic black hole can adhere to unlucky targets, painfully anchoring their bodies in place.","source":"Alien Archive 4 pg. 29","level":"19","price":"555,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"","damage":"6d10","damageType":["B"],"critical":"Bind","bulk":"3","special":["explode (10 ft.)","force","gravitation (20 ft.)","unwieldy"],"capacity":"80"}
