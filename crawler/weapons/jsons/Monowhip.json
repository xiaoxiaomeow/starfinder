Weighted at one end and spooled from a tough carbon-fiber grip, it delivers surgical-quality lacerations with minimal strength. The cuts delivered are so clean that victims sometimes fail to notice a severed limb until they are overwhelmed by a rush of blood loss.","source":"Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 172","level":"15","price":"107,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"10d4","damageType":["S"],"critical":"severe wound","bulk":"L","special":["analog","disarm","reach","trip"],"capacity":""}
