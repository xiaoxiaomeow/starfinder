A dimensional disruption weapon creates a stream-like gravitational wave function that disrupts subatomic fields in an effect similar to a sonic attack, but it can stagger a target rather than deafen it, as the wave function momentarily disrupts the fabric of space around the target.","source":"Starfinder Dead Suns Adventure Path pg. 259, Starfinder #5: The Thirteenth Gate pg. 39","level":"8","price":"1,600","hands":"1","proficiency":"Grenade","category":"","damage":"—","damageType":[],"critical":"—","bulk":"L","special":["explode (2d10 So staggered; 20 ft.)","relic"],"capacity":"drawn"}
