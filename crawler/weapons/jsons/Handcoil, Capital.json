Some of the first versions were produced by starship manufacturers and were accompanied by a promotional campaign suggesting that a starship’s crew should match the starship itself, complete with flight suits to match a given ship’s paint job. Most manufacturers still use the model classification set forth in those early campaigns: explorer, fighter, pilot, and capital handcoils.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 45","level":"11","price":"24,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Shock","damage":"2d8","damageType":["E"],"critical":"arc 2d8","bulk":"L","special":["—"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
