The weapon uses cutting-edge hologram technology to create bursts of hardlight that can briefly interact with both corporeal and incorporeal beings. It takes a bit of training to perfect the timing of strikes made with a hardlight hand wrap, as you must activate the force generator at the precise moment you hit your target, but many feel that the practice is worth the effort. Relatively inconspicuous and easily modifiable to fit any species’ anatomy, hardlight hand wraps are invaluable when facing living holograms, ghosts, and other incorporeal dangers.","source":"Alien Archive 3 pg. 67","level":"20","price":"880,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"11d8","damageType":["B"],"critical":"—","bulk":"L","special":["Bright","Force","Powered (capacity 40","usage 2)"],"capacity":""}
