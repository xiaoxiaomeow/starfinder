A dimensional disruption weapon creates a stream-like gravitational wave function that disrupts subatomic fields in an effect similar to a sonic attack, but it can stagger a target rather than deafen it, as the wave function momentarily disrupts the fabric of space around the target.","source":"Starfinder Dead Suns Adventure Path pg. 259, Starfinder #5: The Thirteenth Gate pg. 39","level":"7","price":"7,500","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Dimensional Disruption","damage":"2d6","damageType":["So"],"critical":"staggered","bulk":"L","special":["boost 1d6","relic"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
