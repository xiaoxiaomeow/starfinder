The tip of a long pole bonds with the target through quantum entanglement. Although a quantum entangler has a nonlethal stun setting, the occasional critical hit caused some victims to die in agony as their cells suddenly decayed and collapsed. The quantum entangler comes in two models; sivv soldiers commonly used the less potent version, while elite units used the more powerful version.","source":"Starfinder #33: Dominionâ€™s End pg. 49","level":"16","price":"170,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Degenerator","damage":"8d6","damageType":["A","So"],"critical":"Degeneration 3d6","bulk":"1","special":["Grapple","hybrid","powered (capacity 20","usage 4)","reach","stun"],"capacity":""}
