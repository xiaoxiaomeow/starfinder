{"key":"Culling Ray, Greater","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Greater&Family=Culling Ray","family":"Culling Ray","name_en":"Culling Ray, Greater","description_en":"Members of the Order of the Culling Shadow sometimes still use shadowstaves for hand-to-hand combat, but they’ve also developed a less discriminate weapon dubbed a culling ray. This black metallic rod has a distinct pistol-like grip and serrations running along the barrel that resemble the spikes of a vicious animal; the culling ray projects a wide field of energy that flays the skin and tissue of any creature unlucky enough to find itself caught in its beam—and then sets them on fire. Energy from a culling ray can cause a breakdown in the target’s molecular structure.","source":"Starfinder #44: Allies Against the Eye pg. 42","level":"12","price":"34,500","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"","damage":"2d12","damageType":["A","F"],"critical":"Irradiate","bulk":"2","special":["Blast","ignite 3d6"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
