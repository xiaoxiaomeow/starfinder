Words and sheer sonic pressure in this cone canâ€™t be ignored. All shout projectors can be installed as armor upgrades (taking one upgrade slot per hand needed to wield the weapon), allowing the projectors to be used hands-free. That way, a user can carry lethal weaponry, safety gear, or protest signage. Exhorter shout projectors can be useful for crowd control with a lighter touch. Damper and pacifier models are ostensibly for nonlethal but more coercive applications, while the riot and crackdown projectors are for heavy-handed use.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 50","level":"20","price":"918,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Sonic","damage":"9d8","damageType":["So"],"critical":"Demoralize","bulk":"2","special":["explode (20 ft.)","integrated (4 slots)","nonlethal","unwieldy"],"capacity":"80 charges"}
