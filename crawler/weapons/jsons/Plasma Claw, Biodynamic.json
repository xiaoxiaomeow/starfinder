The organic plasma claw and biodynamic plasma claw models function most similarly to the original creature. Other manufacturers have created the slightly different electrocellular and synthecite models, which are less powerful versions of the two earlier models.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 42","level":"10","price":"20,100","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Plasma","damage":"2d6","damageType":["E","F"],"critical":"—","bulk":"L","special":["living"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
