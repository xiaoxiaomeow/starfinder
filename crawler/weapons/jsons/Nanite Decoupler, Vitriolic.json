The integrated generators used to overcharge the nanites for the desired effect make a nanite decoupler a heavy, bulky weapon that requires a skilled user. The caustic nanite decoupler and the vitriolic nanite decoupler are both deadly, destructive weapons.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 37","level":"9","price":"15,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Disintegrator","damage":"2d6","damageType":["A"],"critical":"corrode 1d6","bulk":"3","special":["explode (10 ft.)","unwieldy"],"capacity":"10 nanites"}
