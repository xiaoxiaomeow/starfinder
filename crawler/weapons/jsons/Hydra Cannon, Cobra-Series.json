{"key":"Hydra Cannon, Cobra-Series","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Cobra-Series&Family=Hydra Cannon","family":"Hydra Cannon","name_en":"Hydra Cannon, Cobra-Series","description_en":"Rather than firing a single burst of plasma, a hydra cannon generates countless discrete plasma filaments that spread outward in a pattern reminiscent of crawling serpents. The spread of these filaments can be somewhat controlled, allowing a proficient user to avoid hitting a limited number of creatures within the weapon’s area of effect. Python-series hydra cannons offer the least control, while viper-series, asp-series, and cobraseries hydra cannons offer increasingly fine-tuned control over their target areas.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 42","level":"12","price":"41,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Plasma","damage":"4d6","damageType":["E","F"],"critical":"—","bulk":"2","special":["blast","shape 3","unwieldy"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
