{"key":"Mood Goo Emitter","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Mood Goo Emitter&Family=None","family":"None","name_en":"Mood Goo Emitter","description_en":"Immediately after the Crash, deep in the warrens of Absalom Station, space goblins discovered a tiny rupture to the Drift emitting a strange, purplish slime. Physical contact with this slime was found to cause a pleasant, calming euphoria. While this “mood goo” dries after a minute, it can be stored under pressure. The goblins immediately packed this self-replicating substance into insulation foam sprayers and started selling them as riot control gear. These mood goo emitters can fire the mood goo in a line up to 30 feet, allowing their user to select up to 4 squares in that line to become difficult terrain for 1 minute. Any creature hit by the goo gains the fascinated condition for 1d6 rounds, (DC 14 Will save negates). Being sprayed with additional goo doesn’t count as a threat for the fascinated condition and adds to the duration of the original effect, up to 10 rounds maximum. A creature that succeeds at this save is immune to the effects of mood goo for 24 hours.","source":"Drift Crisis pg. 51","level":"4","price":"2,500","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"","damage":"—","damageType":[],"critical":"Knockdown","bulk":"1","special":["Analog","line","unwieldy"],"capacity":"10 mood goo "}
