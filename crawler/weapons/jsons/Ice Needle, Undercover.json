{"key":"Ice Needle, Undercover","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Undercover&Family=Ice Needle","family":"Ice Needle","name_en":"Ice Needle, Undercover","description_en":"This handheld melee weapon appears to be nothing more than a handle with a slot in one end. Once a vial of an injectable substance is inserted into this slot, the ice needle forms a slender spike of ice around that liquid core, allowing you to inject the substance into a foe with a virtually untraceable weapon. Undercover and furtive ice needles are often used primarily for their injecting capabilities, while artifice, espionage, and subterfuge ice needles deal significant damage along with the injection.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 35","level":"18","price":"384,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Cryo","damage":"13d6","damageType":["C","p"],"critical":"injection DC +2","bulk":"L","special":["conceal","injection","powered (capacity 80 usage 4)"],"capacity":""}
