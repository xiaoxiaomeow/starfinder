A sclerite harpooner is inlaid with spirals of kaion shell and magnetically fires either harvested or manufactured kaion sclerites along two rails; this ammunition is available in the same quantities and at the same price as darts. As a reaction, the weapon can be activated to reel in a target affected by its embed critical hit effect. The target must attempt a Reflex save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the harpooner’s item level + the wielder’s Strength modifier) or be pulled 30 feet toward the wielder; this movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Huge or larger creatures are not affected.","source":"Alien Archive 4 pg. 59","level":"9","price":"13,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"","damage":"5d8","damageType":["P"],"critical":"Embed 1d8","bulk":"2","special":["Unwieldy"],"capacity":"50 sclerites"}
