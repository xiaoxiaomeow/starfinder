Originally designed to be a perfect survival tool, the inferno knife combines the cutting prowess of a survival knife with the virtues of a lighter and road flare. By squeezing one trigger, the user can inject a small stream of fuel from the hilt’s reservoir onto the blade’s tip, and a secondary trigger can ignite it, creating a small torch to signal others or light campfires. The product’s launch was disastrous, and users logged hundreds of complaints about the knives’ needless complexity. As a result, inferno knives have flooded the market and become showy weapons for criminals and performers, though timing the blade’s ignition in combat remains an unpredictable art.","source":"Starfinder Dead Suns Adventure Path pg. 54, Starfinder #2: Temple of the Twelve pg. 12","level":"4","price":"2,100","hands":"1","proficiency":"Basic Melee","category":"","damage":"1d4","damageType":["S"],"critical":"burn 1d6","bulk":"L","special":["analog","operative"],"capacity":"1 petrol"}
