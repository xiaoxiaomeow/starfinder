The rifle’s unique construction enables a fully automatic mode, producing a sound like drumming. The frequencies can leave a target’s auditory senses overwhelmed. Pulse staccato rifles have the shortest sonic projector for reliable repetitive shots with less power usage. Surge, drum, and hammer staccato rifles require more charge for a harder hit.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 51","level":"15","price":"107,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"Sonic","damage":"4d10","damageType":["So"],"critical":"deafen","bulk":"2","special":["automatic"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
