The potbellied, shoulder-resting weapons cause a brief but intense sound burst at frequencies and pressure sufficient to rupture living cells while leaving inorganic objects unharmed. The result is a weapon that can eliminate a starshipâ€™s crew without causing any damage to the vessel or its cargo. Those who prefer lighter damage favor harmonic and resonant cannons, leaving anharmonic and parametric models for situations that call for carnage.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 49","level":"13","price":"49,900","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Sonic","damage":"5d6","damageType":["So"],"critical":"Deafen","bulk":"3","special":["antibiological","blast","unwieldy"],"capacity":"80 charges"}
