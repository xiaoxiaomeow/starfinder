The high-powered magnets and tightly wound coils generate intense amounts of power for short amounts of time, but the amount of energy required to do so is immense compared to other clockwork weapons, and the sheer size needed to perform the electromagnetic induction makes EM induction rifles cumbersome to use. However, their analog nature makes them invaluable to factions fighting in null-tech zones or facing technomancers, mechanics, or other agents able to neutralize technological weaponry","source":"Starfinder #50: Clockwork Demons pg. 55","level":"17","price":"255,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"","damage":"6d8","damageType":["E"],"critical":"â€”","bulk":"3","special":["Analog","boost 3d8","clockwork (capacity 80","usage 16)","line","unwieldy"],"capacity":"80 charges"}
