{"key":"Convergent Laser, Single-Wave","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Single-Wave&Family=Convergent Laser","family":"Convergent Laser","name_en":"Convergent Laser, Single-Wave","description_en":"For those seeking efficient laser attacks in a reliable, relatively lightweight format, the convergent laser is an ideal weapon. The weapon’s smaller lasers synchronize and focus their output on a single target to deal more damage than any single beam could deal alone; however, the need to carefully aim and adjust the weapon makes it somewhat slower to fire than its single-beam counterparts. Typically, the different beams originate from the corners of a square or triangular barrel, angling in to join at a single point on the target. A single-wave convergent laser emits a single wavelength, with all its beams sharing a color. Multiwave convergent lasers produce different wavelengths for each beam, using computer assistance to continually adjust the output, while a wide-spectrum convergent laser increases the number of beams until their joining point on the target is a white so brilliant that it’s painful to look at.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 40","level":"15","price":"118,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Laser","damage":"7d10","damageType":["F"],"critical":"burn 4d6","bulk":"2","special":["unwieldy"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
