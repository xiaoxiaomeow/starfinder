{"key":"Capture Pole, Imprisonment-class","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Imprisonment-class&Family=Capture Pole","family":"Capture Pole","name_en":"Capture Pole, Imprisonment-class","description_en":"Built to resemble an ancient pre- Gap weapon used to apprehend prisoners of war, a capture pole consists of a polearm with a twopronged robotic head that snaps shut when its center is pressed against a target during an attack. Designed to lock around a creature’s neck, each of a capture pole’s prongs are outfitted with armor-piercing syringes used to inject a creature with a substance, typically a sedative to make apprehension easier. This occurs on a successful attack roll for a melee attack or grapple combat maneuver. Capture poles are favored weapons among the drow, who use them to capture slaves and discipline their orc servants.","source":"Character Operations Manual pg. 122","level":"20","price":"855,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"15d8","damageType":["P"],"critical":"Injection DC +2","bulk":"L","special":["Grapple","injection","reach"],"capacity":""}
