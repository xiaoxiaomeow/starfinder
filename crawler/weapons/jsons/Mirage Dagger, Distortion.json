This minor displacement effect makes it easier to catch enemies off guard with it. A wide, circular guard protects the wielder’s hand while the blade is active. Distortion mirage daggers are the standard model; hallucination and illusion mirage daggers feature increased damage capabilities.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 38","level":"20","price":"897,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Flame","damage":"10d4","damageType":["F"],"critical":"—","bulk":"L","special":["feint","operative","powered (capacity 20 usage 1)"],"capacity":""}
