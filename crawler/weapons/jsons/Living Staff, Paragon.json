The staff itself can extend, and the vines can wrap around and entangle a target. Xenodruids on sentinel duty favor the tactical and advanced models. The elite and paragon models are more common among highly skilled warrior-mystics undertaking assault missions.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 53","level":"16","price":"181,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Basic Melee","category":"","damage":"12d6","damageType":["B"],"critical":"bind","bulk":"1","special":["block","living","powered (capacity 20 usage 1)","reach"],"capacity":""}
