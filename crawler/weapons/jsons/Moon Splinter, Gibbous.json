Through some sort of interplanar connection, a moon splinter absorbs cold and moisture from the First World to create glowing shards of ice that vibrate with extradimensional energy. Its wielders can then stimulate the woodâ€™s telekinetic magic with a battery, propelling the ice with supernatural force; with each successive strike, the strength of the vibrations increases.","source":"Starfinder #29: The Cradle Infestation pg. 48","level":"10","price":"19,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"","damage":"2d12","damageType":["E"],"critical":"Staggered","bulk":"1","special":["Bright","force","hybrid","living","polarize 1d8"],"capacity":"100"}
