A defoliant grenade unleashes a cloud of rust-red dust that causes vegetation to wither and die on contact. This kills most mundane grasses, shrubs, vines, brambles, small trees, and other moderately thick vegetation, eliminating any difficult terrain caused by those features. Larger trees and wooden objects take full damage but typically are not destroyed outright. Creatures with the plant type take the listed damage and can attempt a Reflex save for half damage. All other creatures and objects are unaffected.","source":"Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 42","level":"7","price":"850","hands":"1","proficiency":"Grenade","category":"","damage":"—","damageType":[],"critical":"—","bulk":"L","special":["Explode (6d6 A","20 ft. see text)"],"capacity":"Drawn"}
