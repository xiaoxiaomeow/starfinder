The weapon uses small amounts of power to produce caustic fluid. The trigger administers a jolt of electricity to the device, causing a reflexive constriction that forces blobs of this acid out of the weapon’s throatlike barrel.","source":"Starfinder #19: Fate of the Fifth pg. 53","level":"17","price":"256,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"","damage":"4d10","damageType":["A"],"critical":"corrode 4d4","bulk":"L","special":["Living","Swarm"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
