A typical survival knife has a fixed, single-edged, carbonsteel or ceramic blade and is treated against corrosion. Tactical knives have large, double-edged blades, often with a section of serrated blade near the haft, and they come in both fixed- and folding-blade designs; users may prefer one style or the other, but the two are identical in terms of price, weight, and damage dealt.","source":"Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 171","level":"1","price":"95","hands":"1","proficiency":"Basic Melee","category":"","damage":"1d4","damageType":["S"],"critical":"â€”","bulk":"L","special":["Analog","operative","thrown (20 ft.)"],"capacity":""}
