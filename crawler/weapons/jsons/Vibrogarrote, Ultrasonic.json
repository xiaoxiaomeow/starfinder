When used, the vibrogarrote makes a distinctive pitch based on how long the wire has been extended. Basic, harmonic, and interference vibrogarrotes produce only audible frequencies, while infrasonic and ultrasonic vibrogarrotes also generate waves outside the typical auditory spectrum for additional damage.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 51","level":"16","price":"189,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Sonic","damage":"6d6","damageType":["So"],"critical":"deafen","bulk":"L","special":["conceal","grapple","operative","powered (capacity 20 usage 1)","throttle"],"capacity":""}
