These components can be made into heavy weapons known as acid lancers, which shoot jets of caustic fluid. A wielder of an acid lancer can squeeze the gland located near the trigger to give her next shot an extra boost of damaging acid. Acid lancers use a special synthetic acid called caustrol for ammunition, which has the same price and comes in the same size containers as petrol.","source":"Alien Archive pg. 109","level":"19","price":"550,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"","damage":"8d8","damageType":["A"],"critical":"corrode 6d4","bulk":"2","special":["analog","boost 1d10","line","unwieldy"],"capacity":"40 caustrol"}
