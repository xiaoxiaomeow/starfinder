A deep, translucent blue, it is reminiscent of thick ice in its raw form, and it glitters with a three-dimensional field comprised of tiny points of light. Kothamas have long fashioned small amounts of the mineral—relative to their large scale—into foci, contemplating the glittering objects during the day or when there is inclement weather as a substitute for the starry night sky. Vesk forces, upon first encountering this mineral, noted its calming effect and immediately set to work developing military applications, eventually fashioning it into supplementary weapons for spellcasters.","source":"Alien Archive 3 pg. 65","level":"15","price":"105,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"6d12","damageType":["B"],"critical":"—","bulk":"1","special":["Unwieldy"],"capacity":""}
