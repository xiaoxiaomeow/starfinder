This weapon fires flares, which donâ€™t typically deal tremendous damage but can distract opponents. Dazzler flare rifles fire a single, relatively ordinary flare, while the vivifier flare rifle breaks open the flare and burns it all in moments, causing far greater light and heat. Coruscator, scorcher, and nova models fire more flares at a time to increase their damage output.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 37","level":"13","price":"43,800","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"Flame","damage":"7d4","damageType":["F"],"critical":"burn 3d6","bulk":"1","special":["analog","bright","harrying"],"capacity":"12 flares"}
