{"key":"Shoulder Laser, Perihelion","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Perihelion&Family=Shoulder Laser","family":"Shoulder Laser","name_en":"Shoulder Laser, Perihelion","description_en":"This laser weapon has a smooth, curved housing and an eyelike aperture, and it can be installed in an armor upgrade slot, leaving the wielderâ€™s hands free for other tasks. As the name implies, most users mount the eyelike aperture over one shoulder, but it can work just as easily mounted on the torso or a forearm. Many shoulder laser users are androids who integrate them into their bodies as emergency weapons. Azimuth, corona, aphelion, and perihelion shoulder lasers are available in most areas.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 41","level":"13","price":"51,500","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Laser","damage":"2d8","damageType":["F"],"critical":"burn 2d6","bulk":"L","special":["integrated (1 slot)"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
