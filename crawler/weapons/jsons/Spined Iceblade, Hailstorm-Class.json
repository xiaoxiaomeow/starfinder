Frostbite-class, hailstorm-class, blizzard-class, and avalancheclass spined iceblades are all readily available in markets that regularly serve kasathas, but similar weapons appearing on distant worlds have intrigued kasathan archaeologists.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 35","level":"19","price":"570,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Cryo","damage":"10d6","damageType":["C"],"critical":"staggered","bulk":"1","special":["powered (capacity 20 usage 1)"],"capacity":""}
