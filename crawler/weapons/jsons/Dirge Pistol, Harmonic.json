Raiders and hijackers prize these weapons for their effect against living targets, which can leave many valuables unharmed. Harmonic and resonant dirge pistols generate stable oscillations, while the anharmonic, parametric, and radial dirge pistols have concentric generator cylinders to produce dissonant and more harmful output.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 50","level":"19","price":"660,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Sonic","damage":"10d4","damageType":["So"],"critical":"sicken","bulk":"L","special":["antibiological"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
