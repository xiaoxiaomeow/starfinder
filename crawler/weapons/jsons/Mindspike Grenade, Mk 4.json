Creatures in the area can attempt a Will save against this grenade rather than a Reflex save. If successful, a creature takes half damage. If the creature fails, it takes full damage and is dazed for 1 round; if the creature’s CR or level is higher than the grenade’s item level, it instead takes full damage and is staggered for 1 round. Treat the CR or level of any creature with limited telepathy or telepathy as 3 lower for the purpose of this effect.
