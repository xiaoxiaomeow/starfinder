This rifle looks like a long, silver cylinder that ends in two long prongs. When itâ€™s fired, lasers ionize the air between the prongs to send a charge at the target that disrupts cellular bonds. The current is powerful enough to penetrate armor but has no effect on nonliving material, leaving equipment lying in a puddle of organic sludge.","source":"Starfinder #26: Flight of the Sleepers pg. 45","level":"8","price":"9,500","hands":"2","proficiency":"Longarms","category":"","damage":"2d10","damageType":["A"],"critical":"Corrode 1d6","bulk":"1","special":["Antibiological"],"capacity":"80"}
