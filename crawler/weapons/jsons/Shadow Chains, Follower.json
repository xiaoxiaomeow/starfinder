Shadow chainsâ€™ links rapidly absorb heat, while their heavily insulated handle protect their wielders from direct exposure to the freezing darkness. Many adherents of the Midnight Lord make use of the follower, acolyte, and penitent shadow chains, while only the most devout can afford the more powerful ecclesiastic and devotional shadow chains.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 35","level":"18","price":"261,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Cryo","damage":"9d8","damageType":["C"],"critical":"bind","bulk":"2","special":["analog","disarm","reach","trip"],"capacity":""}
