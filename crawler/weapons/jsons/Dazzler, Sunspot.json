{"key":"Dazzler, Sunspot","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Sunspot&Family=Dazzler","family":"Dazzler","name_en":"Dazzler, Sunspot","description_en":"Dazzlers are a form of crowd control used primarily for civil peacekeeping. While the weapons use lasers to damage and sometimes blind targets, the beams are carefully calibrated to avoid inflicting lethal injury. Built on similar principles to the smaller compliance ray, dazzlers also tend to bear the colors of local law-enforcement groups. However, the similarities end there, as the dazzler is a bulky device usually carried with the help of a shoulder strap, with its business end covered by dozens of glassy bulbs surrounded by a conical shield. Downplaying this somewhat disturbing appearance, dazzler manufacturer ATech holds up the weapons as an important tool for safe peacekeeping and spreads the weapons wherever AbadarCorp is found. Dazzlers come in flash, strobe, and sunspot models.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 40","level":"8","price":"9,420","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Laser","damage":"2d12","damageType":["F"],"critical":"blind","bulk":"2","special":["nonlethal"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
