Although these rays are legal for civilians to own, most models are themed to fit in with the local constabulary’s armor; the Stewards’ blue-and-gold models are common throughout the Pact Worlds. Shots from these pistols cause intense discomfort, and a hit to the eyes can cause temporary blindness. Models begin with the flash designation and increase in intensity as follows: flare, strobe, starburst, and sunspot.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 40","level":"15","price":"171,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Laser","damage":"6d4","damageType":["F"],"critical":"blind","bulk":"L","special":["nonlethal"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
