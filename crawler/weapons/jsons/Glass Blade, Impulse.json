{"key":"Glass Blade, Impulse","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Impulse&Family=Glass Blade","family":"Glass Blade","name_en":"Glass Blade, Impulse","description_en":"This combat knife is made almost entirely from potassium-treated aluminosilicate glass, a strong, transparent material that retains the insulating properties of glass. A single exposed wire along the leading edge carries a deadly electric charge; the glass of the blade insulates the wearer against electrocution, and a rubberized grip makes it easy to hold. Live glass blades carry a continuous current, while the jolt, impulse, and surge models discharge upon impact.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 45","level":"18","price":"327,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Shock","damage":"13d6","damageType":["E","P"],"critical":"â€”","bulk":"L","special":["powered (capacity 20 usage 2)"],"capacity":""}
