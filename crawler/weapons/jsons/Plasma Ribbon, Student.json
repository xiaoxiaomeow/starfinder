{"key":"Plasma Ribbon, Student","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Student&Family=Plasma Ribbon","family":"Plasma Ribbon","name_en":"Plasma Ribbon, Student","description_en":"While analog battle ribbons are the most traditional of such weapons, increased demand for showier displays in recent centuries has resulted in the development of the plasma ribbon. Much like the analog version, a plasma ribbon is a 10-foot-long ribbon about 3 inches wide, though this version is made from impermeable nanocarbon fiber. A series of fine, flexible wires along the edges produces a narrow magnetic field that turns the weapon into a streamer of glowing plasma in use. Student plasma ribbons allow the user to build up proficiency; battleflowers trade up to professional, competitor, and champion plasma ribbons as they become more skilled with the weapons.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 43","level":"19","price":"578,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Plasma","damage":"6d10","damageType":["E","F"],"critical":"â€”","bulk":"L","special":["operative","professional (dancer)","powered (capacity 20 usage 1)"],"capacity":""}
