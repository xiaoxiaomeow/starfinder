It uses gyroscopic frames to maximize the angular velocity of each attack, and its head is attached directly to the mainspring of the clockwork mechanisms to increase the power at the moment of impact. Despite its ease of balance, the weapon still requires time to properly thrust at a foe effectively.","source":"Starfinder #50: Clockwork Demons pg. 53","level":"19","price":"555,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"9d10","damageType":["P"],"critical":"Bleed 4d6","bulk":"2","special":["Analog","boost 4d10","clockwork (capacity 40","usage 4)","reach","unwieldy"],"capacity":""}
