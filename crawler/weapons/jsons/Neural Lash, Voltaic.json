The neural lash has been bred to include bioelectric cells in addition to its neural fibers, delivering electricity damage and allowing the lash to deal nonlethal damage at its userâ€™s direction. Barathu take credit for the development of the electroplax and amperometric neural lash, but later weapons manufacturers have improved upon those original models by developing the galvanic and voltaic neural lashes.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 45","level":"14","price":"79,400","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Shock","damage":"8d4","damageType":["E"],"critical":"arc 4d4","bulk":"L","special":["Living","powered (capacity 20 usage 1)","reach","stun","thought","unwieldy"],"capacity":""}
