By winding the clockwork of the weapon, it stores large amounts of potential energy wired directly to the hammerâ€™s surfaces. The striking face of a gearhammer contains a pressure-sensitive conductor that releases an electric shock when sufficient force is applied to it. The wielder can throttle the amount of energy released for larger bursts of damage.","source":"Starfinder #50: Clockwork Demons pg. 53","level":"18","price":"375,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"8d8","damageType":["B","E"],"critical":"Staggered","bulk":"2","special":["Analog","boost 4d8","clockwork (capacity 40","usage 4)"],"capacity":""}
