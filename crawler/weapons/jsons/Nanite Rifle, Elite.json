Although the darts deal little damage, the nanites eat into the target immediately and can cause grievous injuries. Nanites from tactical models target the site where they land, while an advanced rifleâ€™s nanites can spread farther within the target. An elite rifle allows its nanites to move even farther from the point struck, dealing more damage.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 53","level":"15","price":"131,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Sniper","category":"","damage":"3d12","damageType":["A"],"critical":"Severe wound","bulk":"1","special":["sniper (750 ft.)","unwieldy"],"capacity":"10 nanites"}
