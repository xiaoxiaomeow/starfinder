{"key":"Sonic Suppressor, Murmur","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Murmur&Family=Sonic Suppressor","family":"Sonic Suppressor","name_en":"Sonic Suppressor, Murmur","description_en":"A sonic suppressor noiselessly creates a static energy field that absorbs and amplifies sound, focusing the captured frequencies back upon the target in a damaging burst. Drow, assassins, and other covert killers favor the weapon because no sound escapes this bubble, resulting in a silent attack and, sometimes, a soundless takedown. The suppressor’s sonic cascade can have an anomalously large initial area, which crashes in from a wider radius, absorbing sound from and damaging those nearby while brutally affecting the intended target. Most manufacturers produce four suppressor models, including the murmur, whisper, hush, and repose.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 51","level":"17","price":"257,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Sonic","damage":"4d8","damageType":["So"],"critical":"stifle","bulk":"L","special":["—"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
