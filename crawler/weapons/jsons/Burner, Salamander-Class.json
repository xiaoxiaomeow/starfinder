However, the subtly narrower nozzle and recoil-suppressing gyros allow a burner to fire streams of petrol with more control and focus than its traditional cousin. Ifrit-, salamander-, hellhound-, firedrake-, and phoenix-class burners are all widely available.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 37","level":"20","price":"795,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Flame","damage":"10d10","damageType":["F"],"critical":"burn 5d6","bulk":"2","special":["line","unwieldy"],"capacity":"40 petrol"}
