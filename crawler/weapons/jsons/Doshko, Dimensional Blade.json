Ideal for devastating overhand blows and catching and parrying enemy weapons, its use is a highly respected art form in traditional vesk society, but it also sees use by creatures of other races as a variant axe. Traditionally, doshkos are made of steel, but in recent decades they have been crafted using advanced metallurgic techniques and even quantum technology to improve the stabbing edges.","source":"Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 173","level":"17","price":"248,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"10d12","damageType":["P"],"critical":"â€”","bulk":"1","special":["powered (capacity 20 usage 1)","unwieldy"],"capacity":""}
