These devices invert matter-antimatter annihilation; instead of generating massive amounts of heat from a tiny speck of matter, an energy converter generates a tiny speck of matter by drawing an incredible amount of heat energy from a nearby area. Tactical, advanced, and elite energy converters each create relatively larger flecks of matter, drawing their energy from a larger area in order to do so.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 34","level":"10","price":"20,900","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Cryo","damage":"2d8","damageType":["C"],"critical":"staggered","bulk":"3","special":["explode (15 ft.)","unwieldy"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
