A similar crystalline structure tuned to particular frequencies turns electricity into sound as it agitates the crystal. The sonorous staff is named for the pleasant tone it strikes, while the reverberant model echoes with a few different tones. A stentorian resonant staff is like the reverberant model but punctuates its blows with distinctive sonic cracks.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 50","level":"13","price":"49,900","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Sonic","damage":"5d6","damageType":["So"],"critical":"knockdown","bulk":"1","special":["block","boost 2d6","powered (capacity 20","usage 1)"],"capacity":""}
