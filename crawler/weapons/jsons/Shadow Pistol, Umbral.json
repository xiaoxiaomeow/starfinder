With their shadowy appearance, the caliginous and sable models resemble guns cut from polished obsidian, while the more advanced tenebrous and umbral models look more like they were cut from the blackness of space.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 35","level":"12","price":"35,400","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Cryo","damage":"2d10","damageType":["C"],"critical":"blind","bulk":"L","special":["—"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
