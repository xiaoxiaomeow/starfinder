{"key":"Aurora Cannon, Proton","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Proton&Family=Aurora Cannon","family":"Aurora Cannon","name_en":"Aurora Cannon, Proton","description_en":"The aurora cannon is a variant plasma cannon with holding chambers that overcharge the plasma generated within the weapon. The walls of these chambers are typically translucent, allowing a veiled view of the shifting plasma. The aurora cannonâ€™s modified plasma blasts cause creatures it hits to glow with a surprisingly beautiful aura, making it difficult for them to hide. Aurora cannons are categorized according to the primary composition of these auroras, from the hydrogen aurora cannon to the electron and proton models.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 41","level":"10","price":"18,200","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Plasma","damage":"6d4","damageType":["E","F"],"critical":"blind","bulk":"2","special":["aurora"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
