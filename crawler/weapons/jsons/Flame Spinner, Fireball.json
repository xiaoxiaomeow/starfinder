{"key":"Flame Spinner, Fireball","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Fireball&Family=Flame Spinner","family":"Flame Spinner","name_en":"Flame Spinner, Fireball","description_en":"A flame spinner consists of two weighted balls attached to a length of cable; the pair is spun in an elegant, showy dance of spinning fire. Fireball and immolation flame spinners use petrol to generate a flaming nimbus around the ballâ€™s metal casing, while supernova and fission flame spinners dispense with the casing and instead compress the petrol to generate a dense mass of blazing heat in place of each ball. Using a flame spinner effectively is difficult due to the complex handling required, and kasathas and other races with additional limbs find they have a substantial advantage in that regard.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 37","level":"20","price":"802,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Flame","damage":"8d12","damageType":["F"],"critical":"burn 5d6","bulk":"1","special":["analog","free hands (2)","fueled (capacity 20 usage 1)","unwieldy"],"capacity":""}
