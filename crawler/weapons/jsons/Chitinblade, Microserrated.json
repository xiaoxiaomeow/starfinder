The source material can come from a natural part of a creature’s body, but the final weapon is detached and wielded with two hands. A tactical chitinblade is modeled on an animal counterpart with little modification, but high-tech materials and manufacturing improve on nature in the microserrated, nanoserrated, and ultraserrated models.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 52","level":"17","price":"219,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Basic Melee","category":"","damage":"8d8","damageType":["S"],"critical":"bleed 3d8","bulk":"1","special":["analog"],"capacity":""}
