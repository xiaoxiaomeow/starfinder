Such force fields are of limited strength, but higher power shield projectors can create a stronger protective barrier around the target. Shield projectors see the most use among security forces assigned to protect diplomats and high-profile celebrities. Available models—from the least to most powerful— include sentry, defender, guardian, and warden shield projectors.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 53","level":"19","price":"594,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"","damage":"—","damageType":[],"critical":"—","bulk":"2","special":["shield 4d12","unwieldy"],"capacity":"100 charges"}
