Taclashes were originally used by military organizations as a form of crowd control, and explorers and mercenaries came to appreciate the utility of the weapon. When a numbing taclash connects, a low electrical shock transmits through the lash. The shock is too mild to deal damage, but it can stun the target.","source":"Starfinder Core Rulebook pg. 172","level":"11","price":"24,800","hands":"1","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"5d4","damageType":["S"],"critical":"â€”","bulk":"L","special":["disarm","powered (capacity 20 usage 2)","reach","stun","trip"],"capacity":""}
