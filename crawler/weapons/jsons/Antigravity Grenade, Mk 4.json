Each grenade reduces the area’s gravity strength (Core Rulebook 401–402) by a number of steps based on the grenade’s model: extreme gravity to high gravity to standard gravity to low gravity to microgravity (effectively zero gravity with some exceptions, listed below). The grenade has no effect in zero gravity conditions; it cannot reduce gravity to less than microgravity conditions, and the effects of multiple antigravity grenades are not cumulative.","source":"Galaxy Exploration Manual pg. 41","level":"19","price":"83,000","hands":"1","proficiency":"Grenade","category":"","damage":"—","damageType":[],"critical":"—","bulk":"L","special":["Explode (4 steps for 2 rounds","15 ft.)"],"capacity":"Drawn"}
