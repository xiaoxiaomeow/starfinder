The energy blasts from a bone pistol are a special blend of cold and negative energy that passes harmlessly over the nonliving. Bone pistols are commonly categorized as grave-class, crypt-class, sepulcher-class, and vault-class.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 34","level":"11","price":"25,500","hands":"1","proficiency":"Small Arms","category":"Cryo","damage":"2d8","damageType":["C"],"critical":"â€”","bulk":"L","special":["antibiological"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
