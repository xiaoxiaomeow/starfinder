{"key":"Radcannon, Rapid-Decay","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Rapid-Decay&Family=Radcannon","family":"Radcannon","name_en":"Radcannon, Rapid-Decay","description_en":"Radcannons are large, dangerous-to-wield weapons typically employed by desperate, reckless, or unliving users. A radcannon’s high-voltage capacitors channel energy through a magnetron and transformer to generate massive blasts of radioactive waves, burning targets and typically exposing the target—and potentially the user—to dangerous levels of radiation. Devourer cultists often employ electromagnetic radcannons, neutron radcannons, and even rapid-decay radcannons, unfazed by the weapons’ danger.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 38","level":"10","price":"18,700","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Flame","damage":"3d6","damageType":["F"],"critical":"irradiate","bulk":"2","special":["blast","radioactive","unwieldy"],"capacity":"40 charges"}
