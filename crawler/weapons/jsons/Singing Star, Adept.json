The wielder swings the chain, either tangling targets or using the metal sphere like a long flail, while the ridges cause the weapon to make an eerie and discomfiting whistle. Traditional versions are made from materials taken from the greatest of Vesk-6â€™s predators, while more modern versions are typically made of polyceramic or carbonsteel.","source":"Drift Crisis pg. 63","level":"17","price":"245,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"","damage":"8d6","damageType":["B"],"critical":"Knockdown","bulk":"2","special":["Analog","disarm","reach","trip","Professional (Musician)"],"capacity":""}
