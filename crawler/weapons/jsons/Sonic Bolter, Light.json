This concentrated, low-frequency vibration damages the body and jostles internal organs, causing dizziness, pain, and slight nausea. Members of the Android Abolitionist Front developed the light model upon discovering the effect of a similar beam. Heavy, assault, and devastator bolters can generate sufficient sound pressure to damage artificial and unliving creatures.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 51","level":"18","price":"398,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Heavy","category":"Sonic","damage":"3d12","damageType":["So"],"critical":"Sicken","bulk":"2","special":["antibiological","line","unwieldy"],"capacity":"20 charges"}
