Weaponsmiths can stabilize the claws’ supernatural ignition and incorporate them into bladed gauntlets known as ignurso knuckles. These gauntlets’ ignurso-hide coverings protect the wielder from the claws’ heat, and high-end models allow the claws to retract into wrist sheathes.","source":"Alien Archive 4 pg. 51","level":"13","price":"50,250","hands":"1","proficiency":"Basic Melee","category":"","damage":"4d6","damageType":["F","S"],"critical":"Wound","bulk":"L","special":["Analog","penetrating"],"capacity":""}
