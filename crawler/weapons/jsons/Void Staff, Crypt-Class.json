{"key":"Void Staff, Crypt-Class","url":"https://www.aonsrd.com/WeaponDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Crypt-Class&Family=Void Staff","family":"Void Staff","name_en":"Void Staff, Crypt-Class","description_en":"Quite common on Eox, void staves are designed using extensive necromancy-derived technologies, resulting in nonreflective black coloration and a range of morbid effects. A target struck by a void staff suffers effects similar to frostbite, as the weapon drains the life energy out of the target on a cellular level and, in some cases, causes complications with breathing and other essential functions. Grave-class, crypt-class, tomb-class, and ossuary-class void staves are relatively common throughout the Pact Worlds, while barrow-class void staves are almost never seen anywhere except Eox.","source":"Starfinder Armory pg. 36","level":"20","price":"904,000","hands":"2","proficiency":"Advanced Melee","category":"Cryo","damage":"9d10","damageType":["C"],"critical":"suffocate","bulk":"1","special":["analog","block"],"capacity":""}
