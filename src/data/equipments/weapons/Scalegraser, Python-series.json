	"description_en": "Designed to be smuggled into secure locations and overwhelm local defenses, the scalegraser is stealthy artillery that breaks into 31 components and uses innocuous batteries as ammunition. Its plasma bolts fragment on impact, causing unpredictable collateral damage, which is often the goal. The scalegraserâ€™s indiscriminate ordinance intimidates Aspis enemies and can incinerate evidence of Aspis crimes, making this a favorite weapon among cleaner crews.",
