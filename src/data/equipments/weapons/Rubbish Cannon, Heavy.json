	"description_en": "A rubbish cannon is a long metal tube with a trigger, similar to a rocket launcher. Instead of rockets or other mass-produced ammunition, a rubbish cannon is loaded with 1 bulk of junkâ€”useless trash found in most urban environments. The inert electronic equipment used as a target for many of the junk spells works best.",
