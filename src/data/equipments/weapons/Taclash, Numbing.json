	"description_en": "A tactical lash, or taclash as it is commonly called, is a length of nylon cord reinforced with carbon fibers. Taclashes were originally used by military organizations as a form of crowd control, and explorers and mercenaries came to appreciate the utility of the weapon. When a numbing taclash connects, a low electrical shock transmits through the lash. The shock is too mild to deal damage, but it can stun the target.",
