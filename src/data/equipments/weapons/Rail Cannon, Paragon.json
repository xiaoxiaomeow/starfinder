	"description_en": "Rail cannons are scaled-up versions of rail guns, and like rail guns, they use magnetic fields to rapidly accelerate ammunition. A rail cannon generates such phenomenal force that its rounds can pass entirely through multiple targets, allowing the user to hit multiple targets in a line. Tactical rail cannons are precise and effective, while advanced rail cannons offer more firepower; elite and paragon rail cannons are generally used only by heavyweapons specialists in professional military groups.",
