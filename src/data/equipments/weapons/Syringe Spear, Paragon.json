	"description_en": "At a glance, this weapon resembles a massive medicinal syringe that has been affixed to a pole roughly as long as the wielderâ€™s body. A tank found at the butt of the spear allows substances to be poured into the weapon, and a spring-loaded mechanism automatically injects foes upon striking a successful blow. The exact origins of this dastardly weapon are unknown, though both the grays and a notorious race of subterranean creatures from Golarion are claimed to have designed this weapon for torturous experimentation.",
