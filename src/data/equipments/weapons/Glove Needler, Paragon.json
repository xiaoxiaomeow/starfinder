	"description_en": "Featuring a hand-mounted firing device that injects its target with acidic compounds, this weapon resembles a cross between a caustoject and cestus pistol. By default, the weapon uses a miniature battery to create caustic fields to inject into foes, but it can launch syringes of other substances when properly loaded with them (in which case only the injection effect occurs—no acid damage is dealt).",
