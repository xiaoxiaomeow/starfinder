	"description_en": "Plasma rings are relatively flat, circular weapons with an easily grippable interior, allowing them to be used in a variety of orientations. Plasma cycles through a channel within the ring at high speeds, and a release valve allows a stream of plasma to escape in a directed jet. Single-valve plasma rings produce a small discharge, while dual-valve plasma rings have a synchronized pair of valves to produce a larger discharge. Multichannel plasma rings build plasma in a series of parallel rings that vent into a single release valve for an extremely powerful blast.",
