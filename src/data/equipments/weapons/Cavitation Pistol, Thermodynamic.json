	"description_en": "A series of prongs takes the place of this pistolâ€™s barrel; firing the weapon causes a small sphere of energy to form at their center and launch forward at speed. If the wielder times the shot perfectly, the plasma sphere pulses just as it hits the target, dealing damage to nearby creatures, but most find the feat difficult to replicate consistently. A vapor cavitation pistol creates a very focused sphere, while the inertial cavitation pistol creates one that implodes on impact. Hydrodynamic and thermodynamic cavitation pistols use more complex reactions that carry significantly more destructive power.",
