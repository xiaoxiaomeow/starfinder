	"description_en": "When assembled, an assassin rifle looks similar to a typical sniper rifle. Its modular construction, however, allows it to be broken down into small component parts that can be hidden on the user’s person—or even smuggled in a ysoki’s cheek pouches—making the weapon difficult to detect or identify. Assassin rifles are available in stalker, shadow, phantom, spectre, and wraith models.",
