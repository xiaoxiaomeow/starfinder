	"description_en": "A dragon pistol features a wide muzzle that is often shaped like a dragon’s maw. The weapon discharges discrete orbs of flaming petrol that can cling to targets. A wyrmling dragon pistol casts small petrol globules, while drake and wyvern dragon pistols have increased outputs. The true dragon pistol is as devastating as it is rare.",
