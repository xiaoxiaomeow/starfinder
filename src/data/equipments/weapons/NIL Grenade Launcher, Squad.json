	"description_en": "NIL (an acronym for “neutronic individual launcher”) grenade launchers are the most common grenade launcher available on the market. NILs can be fitted with any sort of grenade as ammunition. Grenades are loaded individually, rather than in magazines. You can load different types of grenades into a NIL grenade launcher, and you can select which grenade to fire as part of the action used to make an attack.",
