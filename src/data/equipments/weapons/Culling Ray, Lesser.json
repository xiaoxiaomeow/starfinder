	"description_en": "Members of the Order of the Culling Shadow sometimes still use shadowstaves for hand-to-hand combat, but they’ve also developed a less discriminate weapon dubbed a culling ray. This black metallic rod has a distinct pistol-like grip and serrations running along the barrel that resemble the spikes of a vicious animal; the culling ray projects a wide field of energy that flays the skin and tissue of any creature unlucky enough to find itself caught in its beam—and then sets them on fire. Energy from a culling ray can cause a breakdown in the target’s molecular structure.",
