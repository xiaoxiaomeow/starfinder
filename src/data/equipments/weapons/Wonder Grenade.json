	"description_en": "When it detonates, a wonder grenade releases a locus of magical uncertainty, which explodes into a strange effect once it makes contact with reality. When the grenade detonates, roll d% on the following table to determine the effect. (The GM is free to make up a similar effect based on your surroundings and circumstances.) If any effect of the grenade allows a saving throw, the DC is equal to 15 + your key ability score modifier.",
