	"description_en": "Gray guards positioned around secret labs often wield these devices to contain rogue specimens. They fire a sphereâ€‘shaped matrix of energy that electrically adheres to other matter, interfering with mobility. Creatures report a sticky, tingling sensation when struck with these weapons and often find strange markings on their flesh from where the energy matrix attached.",
