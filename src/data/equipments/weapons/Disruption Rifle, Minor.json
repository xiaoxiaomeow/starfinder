	"description_en": "Dimensional disruption weapons were available in various forms and strengths, but those left within the Gate of Twelve Suns are pistols (small arms), rifles (longarms), and a few grenades. A dimensional disruption weapon creates a stream-like gravitational wave function that disrupts subatomic fields in an effect similar to a sonic attack, but it can stagger a target rather than deafen it, as the wave function momentarily disrupts the fabric of space around the target.",
