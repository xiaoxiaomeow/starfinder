	"description_en": "Levalochs study weapon technology of the mortal realm with keen interest. The devils have wielded trident-like weapons for millennia, but using fiendish ingenuity and information gained via infernal pacts with mortal weapon researchers, levalochs have developed ways to integrate modern technology into their tridents, combining cutting-edge science with ancient tradition. The tridents included in the table above are examples of levaloch successes in this area and are now common in the hands of levalochs throughout the planes.",
