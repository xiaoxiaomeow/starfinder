	"description_en": "Outsized hammers, mauls are valued for their intimidation factor and effectiveness in battle. A tactical maul is as much an instrument for hammering posts into the ground as a weapon. Advanced mauls include dense, heavy cores to deliver a more forceful blow. Elite mauls and paragon mauls are designed and manufactured more for war than labor, although the weapons can be used as tools.",
