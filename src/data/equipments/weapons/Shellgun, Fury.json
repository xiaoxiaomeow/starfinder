	"description_en": "A bulky weapon favored by scrappy fighters with limited resources, this oversized pistol uses scattergun shells as ammunition but creates a short-range tongue of flame. Thought to be inspired by the longer gulchgun, the shellgun is also a favorite of ysoki. Available models include the bombard shellgun, the blaze shellgun, and the fury shellgun.",
