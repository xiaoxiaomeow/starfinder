	"description_en": "A terminal doshko is the largest and deadliest of the common codework weapons. The large metal shaft houses an easy access control panel for the wielder to adjust the blade mid-combat without needing a free hand. By default, the bright blue force projection resembles a traditional doshko, but many organizations recode their weapons to match their faction. Orders of Hellknights are known to reprogram the shape to mimic their orderâ€™s signature weapon, such as a flail for Order of the Chain or a glaive for Order of the Furnace, while the corpse fleet military brandishes vicious scythes instead.",
