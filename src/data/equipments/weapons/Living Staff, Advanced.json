	"description_en": "Xenodruids developed the living staff, a gnarled and vineswathed pole, to use as a weapon and a sign of their allegiance. The staff itself can extend, and the vines can wrap around and entangle a target. Xenodruids on sentinel duty favor the tactical and advanced models. The elite and paragon models are more common among highly skilled warrior-mystics undertaking assault missions.",
