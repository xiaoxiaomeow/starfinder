	"description_en": "A shout rifle looks less like a rifle and much more like an elongated megaphone. It functions in much the same way, amplifying sound input, such as the wielderâ€™s voice, to an extreme volume and projecting it outward in a wide area. Protest leaders use shout rifles, ensuring that their proclamations can be heard at a great distance. Law enforcement officials also appreciate these weapons for crowd control.",
