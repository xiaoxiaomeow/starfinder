	"description_en": "Many security forces and peacekeepers employ graviton pistols, since these weapons deal no damage but instead push or pull a target. Long rods running in parallel lines form a barrel-like structure that makes such a pistol easy to identify. The available models of graviton pistols start at linear, with vector, tensor, and chiral models are able to move a target increasing distances.",
