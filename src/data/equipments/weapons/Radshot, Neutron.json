	"description_en": "Banned in most civilized regions of the Pact Worlds, radshots are known for the reckless amount of radiation they generate. Despite the objections of the living, radshotsâ€™ signature short barrels and bulky containment sheaths can often be seen in the markets of Eox or at the hip of a Corpse Fleet officer. They are named for the type of radiation waves they emit: electromagnetic, neutron, and rapid-decay.",
