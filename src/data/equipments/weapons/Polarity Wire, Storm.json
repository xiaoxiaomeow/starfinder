	"description_en": "This gauntlet houses coiled wire tipped with a sturdy needle. When triggered, the gauntlet launches the needle toward a target, channeling a deadly shock along the wire a split second later. After this, the gauntlet rapidly recoils the tethered needle in preparation for additional attacks. Due to the weapon’s design, a polarity wire can’t attack targets beyond its first range increment.",
