	"description_en": "A disintegration lash is a marvel of bioengineeringâ€”a technological living organism that feeds on matter by breaking it down with its own high-energy proton-decoupling field. The result is a black, snakelike lash crackling with red-tinged energy, making this a weapon commonly wielded by those looking to intimidate their foes. Disintegration lashes are designated in the standard method for disintegrator weapons: liquidator, decimator, executioner, and eradicator.",
