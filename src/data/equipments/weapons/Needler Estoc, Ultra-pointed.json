	"description_en": "This slender blade is designed to puncture weak points in modern armor and inflict precise wounds on foes. The weapon possesses a small, transparent tank on its hilt, and when its wielder thrusts the blade into a foe, a spring-loaded mechanism forces anything placed in this tank up through thin passages within the blade to be discharged into the target.",
