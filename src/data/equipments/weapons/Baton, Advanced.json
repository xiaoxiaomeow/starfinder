	"description_en": "A baton is a thin, solid metal shaft, usually with a textured rubber grip. A tactical baton can be used to inflict precise bludgeoning blows. An advanced baton, used by elite mercenary and security companies, often has an additional shaft, as well as a weighted end that can be powered to connect with substantially more force than a tactical baton.",
