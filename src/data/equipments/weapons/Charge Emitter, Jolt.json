	"description_en": "This series of insulating reinforced-glass rings can be installed into armor upgrade slots and focuses an electrical charge into a targeted bolt. The sheer power necessary to project a bolt of electricity means that even an impulse charge emitter is a substantial weapon, and jolt charge emitters and surge charge emitters are significantly more powerful. Their relatively slim profile makes them popular for a number of users, from androids and others who benefit from a racial armor upgrade slot, to starship-repair crews in hostile space who want to keep their hands free for their work without leaving themselves totally undefended.",
