	"description_en": "Much like traditional plasma rifles, nova rifles fire coherent gouts of plasma that can potentially travel some distance and burn multiple targets. However, nova rifles have a slimmer profile overall but a larger aperture, projecting plasma that’s both slightly cooler and more diffuse. The nova rifle’s intense visual display makes it a favorite of icons looking to make a statement or simply add pyrotechnics to their shows. Red star, yellow star, and white star nova rifles are all easily identified by the color of their plasma arcs.",
