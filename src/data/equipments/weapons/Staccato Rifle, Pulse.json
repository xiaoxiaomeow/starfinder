	"description_en": "A baffled tube on the underside of a staccato rifle produces and modulates discrete blasts of sonic frequencies. The rifle’s unique construction enables a fully automatic mode, producing a sound like drumming. The frequencies can leave a target’s auditory senses overwhelmed. Pulse staccato rifles have the shortest sonic projector for reliable repetitive shots with less power usage. Surge, drum, and hammer staccato rifles require more charge for a harder hit.",
