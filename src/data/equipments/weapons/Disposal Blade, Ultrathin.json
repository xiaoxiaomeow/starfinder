	"description_en": "A disposal blade is made of salvage from a standard garbage disposal mounted on the back of a metal wrist covering. When activated, its many sharp blades spin rapidly to tear flesh. You must be very careful when wielding a disposal blade, and though your hand isn’t technically holding the weapon, you can’t use that hand for anything else.",
