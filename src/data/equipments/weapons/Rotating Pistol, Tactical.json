	"description_en": "A rotating pistol is a modern execution of an ancient design found on Golarion and several other worlds. The multiple barrels on this pistol rotate while firing to dissipate heat, which allows a more powerful shot without melting the weapon. The rotating pistol’s shots deal significant damage to their target, but the weapon requires frequent reloading. Rotating pistols are available in tactical, advanced, and elite models.",
