	"description_en": "Barathu researchers studying frost worms on Triaxus have modified tissue harvested from worm larvae to produce a new weapon: an armored, toothy tube with bone protrusions that serve as comfortable grips. The frost maw sprays out fluid that forms a coating of electrically charged, gleaming ice formations wherever it is used. With a particularly lucky shot, this ice can form a thick enough coat to freeze a creature in place.",
