	"description_en": "These explosives create temporary fields of reduced gravity, upending foes, helping move large objects, and enabling extraordinary acrobatic feats. Each grenade reduces the area’s gravity strength (Core Rulebook 401–402) by a number of steps based on the grenade’s model: extreme gravity to high gravity to standard gravity to low gravity to microgravity (effectively zero gravity with some exceptions, listed below). The grenade has no effect in zero gravity conditions; it cannot reduce gravity to less than microgravity conditions, and the effects of multiple antigravity grenades are not cumulative.",
