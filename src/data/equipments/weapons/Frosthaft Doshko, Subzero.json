	"description_en": "This doshko has blades formed of deadly ice by condensers situated within the weapon. Few wielders of a frosthaft doshko consider their weapon appropriately sized unless itâ€™s at least as tall as they are. The extra leverage and freezing blades cause the weapon to hit with incredible force, numbing muscles and snapping bones.",
