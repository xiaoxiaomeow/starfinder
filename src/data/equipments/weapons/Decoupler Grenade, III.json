	"description_en": "Although tripods can use other grenades, they are infamous for the decoupler grenades they produce internally. Other creatures in the galaxy, such as the weapon-dealing drow of Apostae, have replicated this horrid tech. A decoupler grenade produces a dense cloud of dark nanites. This cloud provides concealment and corrodes creatures and materials within it. Each creature that starts its turn in the cloud must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC = 10 + half the grenade’s item level) or be subject to the corrode critical hit effect. A creature that inhales the nanites takes a –4 penalty to this saving throw.",
