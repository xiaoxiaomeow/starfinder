	"description_en": "A two-handed hammer with a reservoir of coolant in its head, a frost maul simultaneously bludgeons and chills its target. As most substances become brittle and prone to shattering when subjected to extremely low temperatures, the frost maul excels at damaging objects it hits. Frost mauls come in aufeis, iceberg, floe, and glacier models.",
