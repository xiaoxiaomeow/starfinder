	"description_en": "Indistinguishable from a flamethrower to the lay observer, a burner uses petrol as fuel to produce a strong jet of flame. However, the subtly narrower nozzle and recoil-suppressing gyros allow a burner to fire streams of petrol with more control and focus than its traditional cousin. Ifrit-, salamander-, hellhound-, firedrake-, and phoenix-class burners are all widely available.",
