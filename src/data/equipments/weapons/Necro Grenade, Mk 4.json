	"description_en": "These grenades are crafted to resemble leering, pygmy-sized skulls. When a necro grenade detonates, it expels a shroud of chemical coolants from its exposed eyes and mouth. This freezing gas is laced with minor traces of negative energy, draining the living and healing undead caught in the area of effect.",
