	"description_en": "This heavy, cannon-like device differs from most thasphalt weaponry. Instead of firing force energy created from the electromagnetic reaction, it starts the reaction and then launches the reacting thasphalt directly. An abundance of reinforcement and safety devices results in a particularly bulky, if devastating, weapon.",
