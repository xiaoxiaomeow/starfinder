	"description_en": "Consisting of a series of durable arm plates strapped across a limb, these weapons serve a dual purpose of offense and defense. While ancient manicas may have taken time to don, modern-day versions cover the arm quickly with the assistance of spring-loaded mechanisms. Gladiator manicas are favored by players of martial sports such as brutaris, despite their ungainly size preventing other weapons being wielded with the same hand.",
