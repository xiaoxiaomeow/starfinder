	"description_en": "This device warps reality itself. Creatures in the area must succeed at a Will saving throw or become contaminated by the alternate versions of themselves who would be present in this place in another reality. Creatures who become contaminated by the multiverse in this way take a –4 penalty to one of their ability scores, determined randomly, and a +2 bonus to a different ability score, also determined randomly. This effect lasts for one minute, at which point reality reasserts itself.",
