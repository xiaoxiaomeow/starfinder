	"description_en": "A larger and more powerful version of a dragon pistol, a dragon rifle also commonly bears draconic motifs or iconography in its aesthetic design. The globules of petrol from a dragon rifle are slightly larger than those from a pistol, and the weapon can be set to launch a series of shots in quick succession. Wyrmling, drake, and wyvern dragon rifles are available, along with the powerful and rare true dragon rifle.",
