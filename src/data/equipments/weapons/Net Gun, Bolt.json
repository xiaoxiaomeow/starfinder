	"description_en": "This rifle fires compacted nyfiber nets that unravel and entangle on contact with a target. The rifle’s reloading mechanism operates slowly, requiring a full minute to feed, fold, and compress a deployed nyfiber net. The rarer bolt net gun includes a battery (capacity 20; usage 4) that electrifies fired nets, often knocking targets out cold. Attacks with either net gun target KAC.",
