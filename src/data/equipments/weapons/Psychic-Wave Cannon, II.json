	"description_en": "Unlike weapons that rely on physical projectiles or various energy forms to damage a target, a psychic-wave cannon targets a creature’s mind. The cannon contains an organic neural matrix that converts charges into a mental blast, damaging creatures with overwhelming psychic output. The numeral of a psychicwave cannon’s model indicates the strength of its output, but the weapon can’t harm objects and mindless creatures, as well as those immune to mind-affecting effects.",
