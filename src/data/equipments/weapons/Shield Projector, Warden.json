	"description_en": "A shield projector is a heavy weapon that encases its target in a short-duration force field, akin to that produced by an armor upgrade. Such force fields are of limited strength, but higher power shield projectors can create a stronger protective barrier around the target. Shield projectors see the most use among security forces assigned to protect diplomats and high-profile celebrities. Available models—from the least to most powerful— include sentry, defender, guardian, and warden shield projectors.",
