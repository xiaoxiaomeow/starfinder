	"description_en": "This elongated laser rifle contains additional lenses that further focus its output, creating a powerful beam that can punch through many substances at ranges far greater than those of a typical laser rifle. Dual, triple, and quad focus rifles use increasing numbers of focusing lenses, intensifying the laser but compounding the price. A compound focus rifleâ€™s lenses are specially made of a rare form of glass, creating the most powerful output currently possible for such weapons.",
