	"description_en": "Blasts from this electromagnetic pistol create a magnetic field that hampers a foe’s movement. Barathus working on Liavara developed these weapons, as the magnetic fields ensnare a target without causing it to fall—a useful feature when confronting the operators of illicit harvesting endeavors on a gas giant. Many parts of an anchor pistol are grown from living organisms, resulting in a lightweight pistol that gleams like mother-of-pearl. Voltaic anchor pistols employ typical electromagnetism, while the emergent and inductive anchor pistols use higher symmetries to produce aperiodic force. The flux anchor pistol relies on quantum-phase factors to generate extraordinarily powerful blasts.",
