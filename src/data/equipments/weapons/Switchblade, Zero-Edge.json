	"description_en": "This blade looks much like a single-edged survival knife when opened, but the blade can be folded or collapsed to fit within the grip, making it easier to conceal. A switch on the knife means the blade can be folded or extended as a swift action, or as part of making an attack or full attack. Most weapon manufacturers that offer daggers also produce switchblades, which are made in the same models: tactical, ultrathin, zero-edge, and molecular rift.",
