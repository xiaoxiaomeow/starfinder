	"description_en": "Though smaller and more expensive than a simple club, a shillelagh is often sturdier and made of more modern materials, such as aluminum or fiberglass. A shillelagh is usually used as a walking stick, but some are capable of dealing weighty blows to the head in the hands of those trained in self-defense.",
