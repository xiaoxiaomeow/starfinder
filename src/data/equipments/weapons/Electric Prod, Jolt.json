	"description_en": "Company personnel must occasionally transport animals from one world to another. Large herd animals, such as ruthigs, can be notoriously stubborn, and sometimes a beast proves more dangerous than anticipated. In these situations, crews appreciate this stout electric prod capable of delivering a nonlethal shock that can stun or incapacitate even a surly wolliped. Electric prods see civilian use on Castrovel, Triaxus, and other worlds, where ranchers and farmers utilize them to keep large animals under control without causing permanent harm.",
