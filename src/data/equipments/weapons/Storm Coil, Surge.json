	"description_en": "A storm coil employs an air-core resonant transformer to produce high-voltage electrical output. The resulting bolt of electricity arcs out from the weapon in a line. Though it employs technology similar to the colossus coil, the storm coil was developed independently within the Pact Worlds. Live storm coils and jolt storm coils generate impressive bolts, while the larger impulse and surge storm coils have even farther reach.",
