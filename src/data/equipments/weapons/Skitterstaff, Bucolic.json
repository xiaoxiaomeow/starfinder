	"description_en": "This long weapon originated as a skittermander farm implement. Resembling a long hoe with a triangular, hooked end, it is used by rural skittermanders to defend themselves from predators and dangerous strangers. Other races acknowledge the skitterstaff’s utility as a weapon but are met with puzzled skittermanders’ questions about where they plan to farm with it.",
