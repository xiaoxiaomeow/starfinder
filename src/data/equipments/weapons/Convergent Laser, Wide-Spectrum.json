	"description_en": "For those seeking efficient laser attacks in a reliable, relatively lightweight format, the convergent laser is an ideal weapon. The weapon’s smaller lasers synchronize and focus their output on a single target to deal more damage than any single beam could deal alone; however, the need to carefully aim and adjust the weapon makes it somewhat slower to fire than its single-beam counterparts. Typically, the different beams originate from the corners of a square or triangular barrel, angling in to join at a single point on the target. A single-wave convergent laser emits a single wavelength, with all its beams sharing a color. Multiwave convergent lasers produce different wavelengths for each beam, using computer assistance to continually adjust the output, while a wide-spectrum convergent laser increases the number of beams until their joining point on the target is a white so brilliant that it’s painful to look at.",
