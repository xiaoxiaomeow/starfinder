	"description_en": "Similar in design to the magnetar rifle, a rail gun uses magnetic fields to accelerate its rounds to lethal speeds. While magnetar rifles are more powerful, they’re also larger and heavier, leaving many to favor the smaller and lighter rail gun. The weapons’ affordability makes them a popular choice for members of the Starfinder Society and other exploratory groups. Rail guns come in tactical and advanced models, with the advanced rail gun being slightly larger.",
