	"description_en": "This weapon consists of a black leather glove that is mounted with a small, single-round firearm. Unlike most firearms, the weapon is designed to fire when pressure is placed upon its barrel rather than using a hand-based triggering mechanism. As a result, wielders must press a cestus pistol up against whatever they intend to shoot in order to discharge the weapon’s round, giving the weapon limited range.",
