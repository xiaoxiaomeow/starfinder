	"description_en": "This ring is threaded with a tiny null-space track that stores a single bullet. When activated, electromagnetic force within the nullspace accelerates the bullet along the track before expelling it with extreme speed. The null space firing mechanism creates very little sound, functioning as though the weapon had a silencer accessory (Armory 61). Due to the weapon’s size, it can’t be fitted with any additional accessories and uses only half its item level to determine the number of weapon fusions and fusion seals that can be installed in it. A ring fire worn on a finger is considered to be wielded so long as that hand is free or carrying an item of no more than light bulk.",
