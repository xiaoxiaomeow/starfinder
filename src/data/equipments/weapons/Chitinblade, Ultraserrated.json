	"description_en": "The serrated, sweeping blade of a chitinblade is based on technology recovered from encounters with the Swarm. The source material can come from a natural part of a creatureâ€™s body, but the final weapon is detached and wielded with two hands. A tactical chitinblade is modeled on an animal counterpart with little modification, but high-tech materials and manufacturing improve on nature in the microserrated, nanoserrated, and ultraserrated models.",
