	"description_en": "The thinness and lightness of daggers make them easy to carry or conceal. Ultrathin daggers have sharp, double-edged blades. Zero-edge daggers have blades—crafted with quantum technology—that are so fine, their edges blur. The blade of a molecular rift dagger looks translucent, as if it’s made of glass, and its vibrating particles allow the dagger to slice through almost any substance. Most daggers are available with fixed, folding, or retractable blades.",
