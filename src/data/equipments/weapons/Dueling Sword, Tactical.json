	"description_en": "While dueling swords are crafted to be aesthetically pleasing and are often seen as a mark of rank or tradition, many warriors still train with them to deadly effect. The powered blades of both buzzblade and ripper dueling swords bring this danger into the modern era, while the molecular rift sword—though unpowered— uses a field of disrupted molecules along its blade to slice through nearly anything, and must be stored in a magnetic sheath that never actually touches the blade.",
