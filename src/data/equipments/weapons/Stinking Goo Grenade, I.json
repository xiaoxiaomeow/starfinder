	"description_en": "The greasy gunk that seeps from this device has a powerful odor that bypasses even the environmental protections of armor. Each creature in the area that can smell must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw or gain the sickened condition for 1d4 rounds. A stinking goo II grenade imposes the nauseated condition instead. The substance also makes the area difficult terrain for 1d4 rounds.",
