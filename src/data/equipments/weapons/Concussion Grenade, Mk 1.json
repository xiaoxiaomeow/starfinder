	"description_en": "The powerful blast from a concussion grenade causes a small shockwave that blasts creatures off their feet. Creatures that fail their save against a concussion grenade are knocked prone. A flying creature caught in the blast is affected as if by the trip combat maneuver if it fails its save, descending 10 feet and becoming prone if this causes it to reach the ground. More advanced versions of this grenade explode so forcefully that they also inflict sonic damage. The grenade’s shockwave requires a gas or liquid medium, and this grenade has no effect in a vacuum.",
