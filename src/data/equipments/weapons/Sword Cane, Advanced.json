	"description_en": "This thin blade comes with a scabbard that makes it resemble a stylish cane. Sword canes are popular on Absalom Station, where similar nonweapon items have some popularity as fashionable affectations. A sword cane can incorporate one of the following at the standard price for that item: 20 feet of retractable cable line, a personal comm unit, or a spotlight. A successful Perception check (DC = 15 + the weaponâ€™s item level) is required to identify a sword cane as a weapon when it is sheathed.",
