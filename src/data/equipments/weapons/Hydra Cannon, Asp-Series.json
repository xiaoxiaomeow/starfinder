	"description_en": "Rather than firing a single burst of plasma, a hydra cannon generates countless discrete plasma filaments that spread outward in a pattern reminiscent of crawling serpents. The spread of these filaments can be somewhat controlled, allowing a proficient user to avoid hitting a limited number of creatures within the weapon’s area of effect. Python-series hydra cannons offer the least control, while viper-series, asp-series, and cobraseries hydra cannons offer increasingly fine-tuned control over their target areas.",
