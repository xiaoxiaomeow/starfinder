	"description_en": "This weapon is a lightweight, handheld auto-injector device designed to quickly inject drugs, poison, and similar substance into a creature when pressed against its body. A syringe stickâ€™s patented spring-loaded design features a sturdy needle able to punch through the toughest armor, chitin, and hide. Despite its deadliness, it is difficult to discern a syringe stick from a medicinal auto-injector.",
