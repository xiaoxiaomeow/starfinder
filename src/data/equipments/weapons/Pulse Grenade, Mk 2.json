	"description_en": "A pulse grenade emits a powerful EMP blast on impact whose damage and effects apply only to constructs with the technological subtype. Constructs reduced to 0 HP by a pulse grenade are not destroyed but simply nonfunctional until restored to 1 or more Hit Points. The EMP wave from a pulse grenade is not intense enough to affect augmentations, weapons, armor, or other technological gear.",
