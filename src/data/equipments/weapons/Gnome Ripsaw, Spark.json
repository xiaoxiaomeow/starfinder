	"description_en": "At first glance, this staff seems to be nothing more than a sleek walking stick. Once powered, it transforms into a two-handed blade of terror with peaks of electricity that function like the teeth of a chainsaw. When a wielder scores a critical hit with a gnome ripsaw, it surges out, hitting creatures surrounding the target with a pulsing blast.",
