	"description_en": "Equal parts tool and weapon, a seismic pick is used in Ulrikka Clanholdingsâ€™ mining efforts due to the added impact of its sonic emitters. These vibrations facilitate efficient excavation, and the picks prove similarly effective against armored opponents. Light and heavy seismic picks are equally useful in fighting or mining. Driver and demolition models are really weapons of war far more powerful than needed to perform most mining work.",
