	"description_en": "This significantly larger version of the spelldarter resembles a full heavy crossbow in scale, consisting of a massive rifle stock that's been outfitted with a metallic compound bow and enhanced with eldritch runes. Arrows fired from a spellbolter are broken down into raw magical energy when fired, unleashing blats of pure magic against foes.",
