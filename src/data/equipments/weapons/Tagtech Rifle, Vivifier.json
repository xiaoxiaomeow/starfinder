	"description_en": "Commissioned by Castrovellian game wardens and adopted by bounty hunters, tagtech rifles are designed to sedate distant fauna while illuminating their bodies to ensure the helpless creatures donâ€™t disappear into the foliage. A nonlethal setting encapsulates darts in a kinetic buffer that dissipates much of their force while still allowing the weapon to deliver injections.",
