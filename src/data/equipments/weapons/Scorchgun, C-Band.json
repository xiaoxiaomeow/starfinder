	"description_en": "Common in areas where petrol’s flammability is a liability, such as in the protected jungles of Castrovel, scorchguns employ a microwave emitter to burn targets. The emitter is generally a squat cylinder positioned above the pistol’s trigger, and its adjustable output allows a wielder to deal either lethal or nonlethal damage. The original design, the microwave scorchgun, is the most widely used, and later designs focus on a specific bandwidth, with S-band, C-band, K-band, and X-band scorchguns achieving progressively more power and precision.",
