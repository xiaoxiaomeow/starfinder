	"description_en": "Sondrias usually patrol the Drift to help stranded travelers, but when some were deposited on the Material Plane, these small, six-armed outsiders became less altruistic and more dangerous. Weapon engineers studied their ability to vibrate their razor-sharp talons into a sonic ranged attack, producing a heavy weapon known as a vibrowave generator. In addition to dealing sonic damage in a burst, it can push back foes on a critical hit.",
