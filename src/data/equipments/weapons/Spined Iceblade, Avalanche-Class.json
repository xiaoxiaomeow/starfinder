	"description_en": "The spined iceblade is a variant of the traditional kasathan spined blade. Its longer, curved handle includes internal channels where coolant builds up until it is released by the wielder’s movements. Frostbite-class, hailstorm-class, blizzard-class, and avalancheclass spined iceblades are all readily available in markets that regularly serve kasathas, but similar weapons appearing on distant worlds have intrigued kasathan archaeologists.",
