	"description_en": "A battletune comes in a variety of sizes and shapes, as it mimics the variety of musical instruments found across countless cultures throughout the galaxy. This instrument, however, is sturdy enough to be used as a bludgeoning weapon in combat without activating the battery. When powered, its sonic vibrations instead harm the eardrums of enemies (though this weapon always targets KAC).",
