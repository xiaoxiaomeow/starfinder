	"description_en": "A balanced, wedge-shaped blade affixed to a lightweight haft, a handaxe can be wielded in melee or thrown. The flexibility of handaxes makes them a favorite of explorers of all types, and the basic handaxe is a common tool that can be used as a weapon. A tactical handaxe is made of a stronger, lightweight alloy, while the sintered handaxe uses a denser ceramic material for added heft and a much keener edge. An ultrathin handaxe has a blade so thin it can’t be seen clearly, while the molecular rift handaxe has a blade narrow enough to slice between molecules. Most handaxes have blade covers to prevent accidental injury to the wielder.",
