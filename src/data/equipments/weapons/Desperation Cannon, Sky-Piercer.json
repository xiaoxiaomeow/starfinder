	"description_en": "Few damai are brave enough to confront the titanic colossi that roam the devastated world of Daimalko, but some have no choice. This plasma weapon not only delivers a powerful blast capable of penetrating a colossus’s thick hide, but it delivers a blast of light and noise drawing the target’s attention from others. Some desperation cannons are used in only one battle, unless they’re later recovered from wreckage by scavengers.",
