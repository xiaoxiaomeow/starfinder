	"description_en": "A nanite thrower has a cylindrical nanite canister above the stock, which serves as ammunition. Instead of firing a single projectile, the nanite thrower hurls a coherent cluster of nanites at the target. These microscopic machines burrow in and damage the target from within. Nanite throwers come in similar models to the nanite rifle—tactical, advanced, and elite. With throwers, however, this line extends to the paragon model.",
