	"description_en": "Azlanti arms scientists developed the plasma flare as a assault weapon and a tactical aid. The weapon hurls bright balls of plasma at foes, scorching them and illuminating the area for better target designation in situations of diminished light. The Aeon Guard also finds the radiance to be an effective intimidation tactic, especially against civilizations that have yet to develop advanced technology.",
