	"description_en": "An extrusion rifle creates powerful pressure waves that exit the weapon with an incongruous whisper. The bulk of the rifle is a slender and reinforced cylindrical barrel. When fired, a piston travels from one end of the barrel to the other, compressing the gases inside to extreme pressures before the other end opens and release the projectile. A series of baffles at the rifle’s tip stabilize the pressure wave so that it maintains cohesion over long distances and retains enough power to punch a perfectly clean hole into its target, though it can be modulated to simply hit a target’s surface with forceful impact.",
