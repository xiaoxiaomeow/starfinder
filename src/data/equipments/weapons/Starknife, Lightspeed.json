	"description_en": "Four tapered metal blades surround the central ring of a starknife, which can be thrown or used to stab opponents. Accelerated and lightspeed starknives have gas-powered jets that fire when the starknife is wielded. Solid auras surround the blades of a dimensional slice starknife, which are manufactured with cutting-edge metallurgic techniques. In a sintered starknife, the metal blades are replaced with compressed ceramic blades.",
