	"description_en": "These keen-edged spikes are installed in an armor upgrade slot rather than held, stored in a surface slot in armor or an android’s body until extended. You can extend the spike as a move action and retract the spike as a swift action. Such a spike usually extends from the elbow, foot, knee, or wrist, but a spike can be fitted into a helmet or an android’s head for use in headbutting or goring foes. Retractable spikes are widely available throughout the Pact Worlds, with the various models—tactical, advanced, elite, and paragon—having individual rarity based on the credit outlay to acquire a given model.",
