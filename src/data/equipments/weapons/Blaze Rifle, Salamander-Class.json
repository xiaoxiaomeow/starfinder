	"description_en": "A blaze rifle is a bulky, ungainly weapon, with a rifle stock and two tanks of petrol mounted atop the barrel. Compared to other petrol weapons, the blaze rifle fires a far narrower stream of petrol, which allows for greater accuracy. Fire-loving mercenaries often choose the blaze rifle to avoid charring their allies. Ifrit-, salamander-, hellhound-, firedrake-, and phoenixclass blaze rifles are common throughout the Pact Worlds.",
