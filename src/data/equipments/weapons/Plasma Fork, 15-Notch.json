	"description_en": "Also known as a plasma rail gun, a plasma fork has two long metal prongs in place of a barrel. The mechanism magnetically accelerates a bolt of plasma between these two prongs, but it can also hold plasma temporarily between the prongs to charge up an even more devastating attack. Each model has a number of notches that infuse the plasma with energy, starting with 12-notch plasma forks and increasing in intensity to 15-notch, 19-notch, and 22-notch plasma forks.",
